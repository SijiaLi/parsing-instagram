Diane created these awards to celebrate the women with the courage to fight, the power to survive, and the leadership to inspire - those who become the women they want to be. Last night I was reminded that each of us has the capacity to demonstrate those characteristics every day for the causes we care about. I dedicate the Inspiration Award to the women and girls around the world who pursue their passions, stand up for their convictions and, most importantly, find ways to lift up and shine the light on others.

Caption: My first @Voguemagazine shoot was a month after my 16th birthday. @TheRealGraceCoddington booked me as an extra in a 'Romeo & Juliet' themed shoot starring @cocorocha and photographed by Annie Leibovitz. I hardly slept the night before knowing I was going to be on set with these industry icons. Grace instantly put me at ease with her humor and warmth. At one point she was on her knees helping me put on my shoes...THE GRACE CODDINGTON was on the floor tying my shoes! I couldn't believe it. You would never know it was me in the final images, but it didn't matter - it's a shoot I will never forget.

Thank you, Grace, for your genuine kindness and humility. I am grateful for the many memories and iconic Coddington shoots I have been privileged to be a part of and I look forward to many more. Xx ❤️
